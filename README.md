## Setup

To setup a new day, run the following command

```
npm run setup -- dayX
```

replacing 'X' with the day number, e.g `day2`

Then to run a particular day and particular part, run the following

```
npm run solve -- dayX 1
```

replacing 'X' with the day number, e.g `day2`, and the 2nd argument being which part to run, e.g. `1` or `2`

Helpers for common functionality such as input reading can be found in [`helpers.js`](./helpers/helpers.js)
